Module 2 - Classes and Objects

-Create a class for a noun ( a person, place, or thing)... an OBJECT
-Class members define 
	1. state
	2.behavior

-The class definition is like a cookie cutter, that stamps out cookies
	-Instead, the class definition stamps out objects

Constructors- special methods used to initialize objects.
	-"ctor" + TAB TAB to create constructor in VS

Classes vs variables
	-Class = blueprint for creating objects
	-Class can also be used to type a variable

Reference Types
	-classes are reference types
	-variables hold a pointer value

Access Modifiers visibility
	-public: everywhere
	-private: same class
	-internal: same assembly

Statics
	- use static members of a class without creating an instance
	-can be accessed without creating an instance of that class
	ex) public static flot minimumGrade = 0;
	ex) console.writeline("hello") //don't have to create a console object to do this

-C# for each loop is very helpful

shortcut: type cw + TAB + TAB to quickly make a writeline statement
